# election-analysis

## Project Overview
We have been tasked to complete an audit of a recent election, with the below goals.

Data to retrieve
1. Total Number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of all candidates that received votes.
3. Percentage of votes won by each candidate.
4. Total number of votes by candidate.
5. Winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources

-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Sotfware: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.56.0

##Summary

-369'711 Total Votes
-Candidates were: 
  -Charles Casper Stockham (85,213)
  -Diana DeGette (272,892)
  -Raymon Anthon Doane (11,606)
-The winner of the election was Diana DeGette, with an overwhelming 73.8% of the votes. A clear landslide winner.

##Challenge Overview/Summary

-I really enjoyed the detail the module went into. We were constantly given more than one way to execute alot of this code,
and I believe that will help us out using Python in the future. This challenge is especially pertinent to my current job and 
is already coming in handy. Even having completed this challenge, I don't feel extremely confident with Python, so I will take
some time out and review this module for continued practice.
